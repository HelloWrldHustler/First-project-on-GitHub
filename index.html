        <Ul> 
            <li> <mark>Self-taught programmer and full-stack developer </mark>. It's getting a little bit annoying that i 
                am obligated to say i am not bragging whenever i am talking about my achievements, so please 
                keep that in mind. I have build a crap ton of random, cool, usefull,
                experience bringing projects. Don't believe me? Check them out! Instead of
                believing me, see for yourself. My secret is that i have purchased really really good bootcamp
                courses about python and web development and the instructor is very competent and was really smart
                about how she made the two courses <mark>completely</mark> project based. Shoutout to Angela from the 
                App Brewery. </li>
            <li> <mark>Sales, copywriting, affiliate marketing, SEO and landing page EXPERT</mark>. In order to find your calling, or mission in life,
                whatever you want to call it, you must know thyself and pay attention to what you had interest in 
                your childhood. Since i was a small boy i was doing some business schemes and was recording
                video comercials for random products. Not over-exagerating, since that small age i have always
                seen myself a successful entrepreneur in an expensive suit doing business stuff in sky scrapers. 
                After i learned how to program and make website i could use my business potential to the max.
                </li>
            <li> <mark>Proffesional video editor</mark>. If i wasn't a software engineer, i would totally would be a video editor that edits high level content. You know why 
            I think this skill is essential in our modern economy? Because the conent that people 
            consume in biggest quantaties is VIDEO CONTENT. By making engaging and high-quality videos you set yourself up
            success in our consumerism focused society.   </li>

            <li> <mark>Communication</mark>. I was a shy kid from the beginning and I really wanted to communicate
            and network with other individuals on a high level. Read super knowledgable books regarding this 
            topic and attended improv class, as well as a public speaking club. </li>
            <li> <mark>Project management</mark> know-how. Know how to use goal decomposition in order to achieve ANY goal
                I set my mind to! Project management is what other people call time managament sometimes. You
                can't manage time, you can manage only yourself and your actions!
            <li> <mark>Punctual</mark>. I am never late, only early. </li>
            <li> <mark>Self-discipline</mark>. You can't achieve something worthwhile in life without working your ass off.
                In 99.999% instances you can earn money, learn a good skill and achieve anything worthwhile if you 
                work consistently EVERYDAY. No exceptions whatsoever! This is how i learned how to program, build 
                sites and build, run, automate and maintain whole online businesses!

        <h2><strong> MY EXPERIENCE: </strong></h2>
        <Ul> 
            <li> In summer 2023 got my <strong>first job as a web developer</strong>. Was SUPER excited regarding this.
            Got the job not because of money (even though it was a good bonus), but rather for the 
            network and so i can meet people in my field of work so I can ask for advice from people more
            experienced than me. I was already earning money from my businesses and did not need to get
            this job, but still got it because i 100% believe <strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong> is power. Also the second reason is because my 
            dad told me he would buy me a car if i got this achievement. Didn't give a shit about the car my
            dad would give me, just wanted to prove him wrong and prove to him that i am worth something. After
            him accepting the defeat, i told him not to buy me a car, i just wanted to win and prove him wrong!
            But don't lose 
            viglilance after suceeding. There is a saying that goes "The biggest danger comes at the times 
            of achievements". It was by non the other but Napoleon Bonaparte!
            </li>
            <li> I am <strong>constantly</strong> building websites for my portoflio, i have more than 30 ideas i actually
            have to complete.  It is my end goal with programming. The ultimate goal.  I will be earning big 
            money. All of these sites are made and were engineered to generate money. Each site was more than 
            just a project. It was like I was building online businesses one by one. In order to check out my 
            projects you will have to invite me to a job interview ;).
            </li>
            <li> Made countless TOP TIER selling websites for countless happy individuals and organizations.
            They allowed me to show their wonderfull, dynamic and high-functional websites that I happily 
            made in a tight deadline. I can show you some of them later. 
            </li>
            <li> Besides engeneering the site itself and designing it, there is another <strong>CRUCIAL</strong>
                aspect to websites, it is the copywriting and the marketing, and business moves made.
                I consider myself a pro at this. Read an amazing book called "Perfect Landing Page"
                on my native language Russian and that book taught me everything about not just doing
                freaking landing pages, but about how to start and maintain fully-functional 
                online businesses... If you guys would like for me to share this wonderfull knowledge, than
                contact me.

                just check out my business websites and pay attention to the wording, copywriting and 
                the marketing tactics used by me! Becareful though, you will instantly want to buy whatever I am selling! 
            </li>
            <li> I like to make and edit cool videos. Check them out on my YouTube channel! I didn't make it yet
            , so don't worry.    </li>
